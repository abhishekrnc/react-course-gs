You are given a function levelOrderTraversal(Node root) in which root is passed in it. By using this you have to print the level order traversal of a tree.


Input:   

            10
            /\
           /  \
          20   30
         /     /\
        /     /  \
       40    50   60
Output:= 10,20,30,40,50,60

You have to just complete this function:-

And Node is a class which has data and left and right references
class Node{
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;
}

C++:-
void levelOrderTraversal(Node root){

}

Java:-
public static void levelOrderTraversal(Node root){

}
